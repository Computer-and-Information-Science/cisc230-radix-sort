// sort - Performs a radix sort on the given array. Assumes the given array
//	contains only non-negative integers no greater than 99,999. Since the
//	algorithm works only on integers, this function is not implemented as a
//	template. Further, the idea of a comparison function is not applicable
//	given that the algorithm only supports ascending sort of integer values.
